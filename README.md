# ZKWitches Backend

backend for [zkWitches](https://github.com/ThanksSkeleton/zkwitches)

Check there for documentation.

rename private_keys_dummy.json to private_keys.json to deploy on hardhat (keys need to be well formed even if you're not using them).
replace the values for test+prod when you are ready to deploy to those environments.
